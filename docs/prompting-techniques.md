## Context-Aware Prompting

### The Principle
Provide rich context about your existing codebase, patterns, and requirements to get more relevant and useful responses.

### Examples

#### ❌ Ineffective Prompt
```
"Create an enemy class"
```

#### ✅ Effective Prompt
```
"Create an enemy class for a Donkey Kong-style platformer that:
- Follows the existing Entity base class pattern
- Uses the manager architecture (EntityManager handles lifecycle)
- Implements Q-Learning for intelligent behavior
- Supports different enemy types (barrel, monster)
- Includes sprite animation system
- Integrates with the existing collision system
- Uses the established config system for parameters"
```

### Results Comparison

**Ineffective Result:** Generic enemy class with basic movement
**Effective Result:** Fully integrated enemy system with AI, animations, and proper architecture

### Key Techniques

1. **Reference Existing Patterns**
   ```
   "Following the manager pattern used in GameStateManager, create a TutorialManager that..."
   ```

2. **Specify Integration Points**
   ```
   "This should integrate with the existing CollisionManager and use the EntityManager for lifecycle..."
   ```

3. **Include Technical Constraints**
   ```
   "Must work with PyInstaller packaging and handle asset loading for both development and production..."
   ```

## Incremental Complexity Building

### The Principle
Build complex systems step-by-step rather than asking for complete implementations upfront.

### Example Progression

#### Step 1: Basic Foundation
```
"Create a basic enemy that moves horizontally and bounces off screen edges"
```

#### Step 2: Add Intelligence
```
"Modify the enemy to detect platform edges and decide whether to fall or turn around"
```

#### Step 3: Add Player Awareness
```
"Add player detection so the enemy can move toward the player's position"
```

#### Step 4: Add Learning
```
"Implement Q-Learning so the enemy learns optimal paths to reach the player"
```

#### Step 5: Add Variety
```
"Create different enemy types with unique behaviors while sharing the base AI system"
```

### Benefits

- **Better Code Quality:** Each step is thoroughly tested before adding complexity
- **Easier Debugging:** Issues are isolated to specific functionality
- **Learning Opportunity:** Understand each component before moving forward
- **Flexibility:** Can pivot or modify approach at any step

## Architecture-First Approach

### The Principle
Establish architectural patterns and system design before implementing specific features.

### Example Workflow

#### 1. System Design Prompt
```
"Design a modular architecture for a 2D platformer game that needs to handle:
- Multiple game states (menu, playing, paused, shop)
- Real-time entity management (player, enemies, projectiles)
- AI systems for enemy behavior
- Cloud data persistence
- Asset management
- Sound system

Use Python/Pygame and follow SOLID principles."
```

#### 2. Manager Pattern Implementation
```
"Based on the architecture design, create a GameManager that coordinates:
- EntityManager for game objects
- GameStateManager for state transitions
- CollisionManager for physics
- UIManager for interface
- SoundManager for audio

Show how these managers communicate and share data."
```

#### 3. Specific Feature Implementation
```
"Now implement the EntityManager following the established pattern:
- Manages lifecycle of all game entities
- Handles spawning with rate limiting
- Provides update/render coordination
- Integrates with CollisionManager for physics"
```

### Results

This approach led to:
- **Consistent Code Style:** All components follow the same patterns
- **Easy Maintenance:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalable Design:** Easy to add new features
- **Testable Code:** Each manager can be tested independently

## Problem-Solution Pairing

### The Principle
When encountering issues, provide both the specific problem AND the desired outcome.

### Example Templates

#### Bug Fix Template
```
"Problem: [Specific issue description]
Current Behavior: [What's happening now]
Expected Behavior: [What should happen]
Context: [Relevant code/system information]
Constraints: [Any limitations or requirements]"
```

#### Feature Request Template
```
"Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Current State: [What exists now]
Requirements: [Specific needs]
Integration: [How it fits with existing systems]
Examples: [Similar implementations or references]"
```

### Real Example

#### Problem Description
```
"Problem: Enemies get stuck at platform edges and don't fall down
Current Behavior: Enemy reaches platform edge, stops moving, stays there indefinitely
Expected Behavior: Enemy should detect platform edge and either:
1. Fall to lower platform if player is below
2. Turn around if no lower platform exists
3. Jump to higher platform if player is above
Context: Using pygame.Rect for collision detection, platforms are pygame.Rect objects
Constraints: Must work with existing Q-Learning system and not break current AI behavior"
```

#### AI Solution
The AI provided a comprehensive solution with edge detection, decision logic, and Q-Learning integration.

## Constraint-Based Prompting

### The Principle
Specify technical constraints, limitations, and requirements upfront to get practical solutions.

### Constraint Categories

#### 1. Technical Constraints
```
"Must work with Python 3.12+, Pygame 2.5.2, and be compatible with PyInstaller packaging"
```

#### 2. Performance Constraints
```
"Should maintain 60 FPS with up to 50 entities on screen simultaneously"
```

#### 3. Memory Constraints
```
"Keep memory usage under 100MB for the entire game"
```

#### 4. Platform Constraints
```
"Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux without platform-specific code"
```

#### 5. Integration Constraints
```
"Must integrate with existing Firebase authentication and work offline as fallback"
```

### Example: Build System Prompt

```
"Create a build script for a Python/Pygame game that:

Technical Constraints:
- Uses PyInstaller for packaging
- Must handle NumPy conflicts (common PyInstaller issue)
- Should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Must include all assets (images, sounds, config files)

Functional Requirements:
- Automatically install dependencies if missing
- Clean previous builds before starting
- Generate platform-specific installers
- Include user documentation in the package
- Provide detailed build reports

Error Handling:
- Graceful failure with clear error messages
- Rollback capability if build fails
- Validation of all required files before building

Output:
- Single executable file
- Installation instructions
- Configuration templates"
```

### Result
The AI created a comprehensive build system that handled all constraints and provided robust error handling.

## Code Review Prompting

## Advanced Prompting Strategies

### 1. Multi-Step Reasoning

```
"I need to implement enemy AI that adapts to player behavior. Let's think through this step by step:

Step 1: What data should we collect about player behavior?
Step 2: How should we process this data to identify patterns?
Step 3: How should the AI adapt its behavior based on these patterns?
Step 4: How do we balance adaptation with predictable gameplay?
Step 5: How do we implement this efficiently in a real-time game loop?

Please work through each step and then provide a complete implementation."
```

### 2. Comparative Analysis

```
"Compare these three approaches for enemy AI in a platformer game:

Approach 1: State machines with predefined behaviors
Approach 2: Q-Learning with reward-based learning
Approach 3: Hybrid system combining rules and learning

For each approach, analyze:
- Implementation complexity
- Performance characteristics
- Player experience impact
- Maintainability
- Extensibility

Then recommend the best approach for a Donkey Kong-style game and provide implementation details."
```

### 3. Constraint Optimization

```
"Optimize this game system for:
- 60 FPS performance with 100+ entities
- Memory usage under 50MB
- Startup time under 3 seconds
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Maintainable code structure
